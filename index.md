[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is a really important tool for
reproducible research.

[Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/), the developer of knitr, has written
clear and thorough [documentation](http://yihui.name/knitr/), many
useful
[examples](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/vignettes) and
[demos](http://yihui.name/knitr/demos), and a very nice
[book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1482203537/7210-20).
And, admittedly, I don't have very extensive knowledge of knitr.
Nevertheless, I thought it might be useful to have some of the basic things
explained again a bit differently.

And so, here is a brief guide to knitr covering reports (with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)) and papers (with
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org)). I intend to later add further
information on creating presentations and posters
(with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) and
[Beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX)).
