title: Knitr with Latex
---

If you want precise control of a document,
[Latex](http://www.latex-project.org) is a great way to go. It's much
more complicated than
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), but if you're
writing a journal article, thesis, or book, 

I'm assuming here that you already know how to write a Latex
document. If you don't, I'd suggesting focusing first on using knitr
with markdown, study Latex elsewhere (I like
[this book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321173856/7210-20)),
and then coming back to this.

**More to come.**
