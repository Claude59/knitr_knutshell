[KnitR](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is a really important tool for
reproducible research. You create documents that are a mixture of
text and code; when processed through KnitR, the code is replaced by
the results and/or figures produced.

[Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/), the developer of KnitR, has written
clear and thorough [documentation](http://yihui.name/knitr/), many
useful
[examples](https://github.com/yihui/knitr/tree/master/vignettes) and
[demos](http://yihui.name/knitr/demos), and a very nice
[book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1482203537/7210-20).
Nevertheless, I thought it might be useful to have some of the basic things
explained again a bit differently.

And so, here is a brief guide to KnitR, covering the fundamentals of
its use with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/),
[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/), and 
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org).

If you find KnitR useful, consider buying
[Yihui's book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1482203537/7210-20).
