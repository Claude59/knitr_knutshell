title: knitr in a knutshell
---

[Knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/) is a really important tool for
reproducible research.

I intend to write a brief guide to knitr covering reports (with
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) and
[asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)), papers (with
[LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org)), and presentations and posters
(with [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org) and
[Beamer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamer_(LaTeX))).

Stay tuned.
