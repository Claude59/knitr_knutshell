title: Knitr with asciidoc
---

[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/) is similar to
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/): a simple,
readable text markup that can be converted to [html](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).

For simple reports, I'm satisfied with
[R Markdown](http://www.rstudio.com/ide/docs/r_markdown), but for a
long report with a lot of sections, it's nice to have a sidebar with a
floating table of contents. (See
[this example](../assets/knitr_example_asciidoc.html)
and its
[AsciiDoc source](../assets/knitr_example.asciidoc).)

An important part of the appeal of Markdown is the limited set of
simple marks. But sometimes you want just a little bit extra, like
subscripts (e.g., in describing an F<sub>1</sub> hybrid). You can
insert a bit of html code, but it's even better to use a similar
system with a more rich syntax, like
[AsciiDoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/).



**More to come.**
