title: Knitr from Sweave
---

If you have experience using [Sweave](http://leisch.userweb.mwn.de/Sweave/) with
[Latex](http://www.latex-project.org), you'll find that it will be an
easy transition from Sweave to [knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/), and
one well worth making.

[Yihui Xie](http://yihui.name/) has written a great document on the
[Transition from Sweave to knitr](http://yihui.name/knitr/demo/sweave/). Here,
I'll just give a thumbnail sketch.

**More to come.**
